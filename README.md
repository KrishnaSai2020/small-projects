# small-projects
Just full small simple python projects I've done. A lot of them were done as I was learning python and I really have no issue at all in anyone copying them etc do as you wish.

So far in here the projects are as follows:

. pdf file merger
. image format conerverter

Notes:
  When using the image format converter you can easily change it to convert different file formats.
